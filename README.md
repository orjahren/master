# Master thesis repo

A public repo for my masters thesis.

My thesis is about using [large language models (LLMs) for decreasing
driveability in autonomous driving system simulator
scenarios](https://www.simula.no/education/masters-students/masters-projects/large-language-models-adaptation-cyber-physical-system).
This allows up to find unknown faults they may have before they are allowed onto
the roads where they can cause harm. The results show that this is a usefeul way
of solving this problem.

The thesis is being written at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://simula.no)
and is scheduled for final submission 17 November 2025.

Code for the thesis experiments is located in
[this standalone repo](https://github.com/orjahren/master-hefe).

PDF of the thesis [is available here](https://orjahren.github.io/master/thesis.pdf).
<br/><br/>The thesis currently has 110 / 100 pages, which is
110.00 percent.
