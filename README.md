# Master thesis repo

A public repo for my masters thesis.

My thesis is about using [large language models (LLMs) for improving autonomous
driving system testing](https://www.simula.no/education/masters-students/masters-projects/large-language-models-adaptation-cyber-physical-system).

The thesis is being written at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://simula.no)
and is scheduled for final submission 17 November 2025.

Code for the thesis experiments is located in
[this standalone repo](https://github.com/orjahren/master-hefe). Currently very WIP.

PDFs are available for the
[essay here](https://github.com/orjahren/master/blob/main/essay/final.pdf) and the
[thesis here](https://orjahren.github.io/master/thesis/thesis.pdf).
