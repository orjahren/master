\chapter{Scenario file diffs}\label{sec:fileDiffs}

The diffs represent the \emph{diff}erence between two files, highlighting what
has changed. In this context -- the red indicates something that was changed
from the original scenario, and the green indicates something that was added by
the \acrshort{llm}. The lines in black are unchanged.
