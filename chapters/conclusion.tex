\chapter{Conclusion}

\epigraph{This inductively justifies the conclusion that induction cannot justify any conclusions}{David Deutsch}

In this master's thesis, we propose a tool -- \hefe -- for using \acrfullpl{llm} to decrease the
driveability of \acrfull{ads} scenarios in order to expose underlying weaknesses in the
\acrshort{ads}. We show this work is in line with other works in the field, and we show that our
results are TODO.
