In this master's thesis, we propose a tool -- \hefe{}~-- for using \acrshortpl{llm} to decrease the
driveability of \acrshort{ads} scenarios in order to increase confidence in the \acrshort{ads} and
expose underlying weaknesses in the system. We show this work is in line with what is to be expected
from comparison with other related works in the field, validating that the concept works quite well
for focusing on making less significant changes to the original scenario with a focus on the jerk
metric. When allowing the \acrshort{llm} to make excessive changes to the scenario, problems related
to hallucination and simulator crashes arise under our current \acrshort{llm}- and prompting
strategies.

We used the \acrshortpl{llm} \texttt{Mistral 7.2}B and \texttt{gemini-2.5-flash}
and various original prompts. The scenarios we used for evaluating the tool came
from the the example set provided with the Carla scenario runner. The results
obtained indicate a \num{63}\% error rate of running a scenario after it has
been enhanced. We classified these errors into \num{4} categories based on what
caused the execution to fail.

We propose several strategies for improving this initial version of the tool in
\Nref*{chp:furtherWork}.
