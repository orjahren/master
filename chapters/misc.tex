\chapter*{Abstract}

\acrfullpl{ads} rely on extensive testing in order to verify their operational safety. But due to
their nature of being able to operate in any unseen environment with arbitrary external actors,
the number of potential scenarios is infinite. It is therefore important to obtain the least
driveable scenarios for simulator testing ahead of real world deployment. We therefore propose
applying \acrlongpl{llm} to \acrlong{ads} scenario files to decrease their driveability, exposing
potential underlying issues in the \acrshort{ads} being tested in advance of it happening during
real world operation, avoiding causing severe damage to its operator and/or other external actors.
