\section{\acrshort{llm} aspects}

\subsection{Different promtping strategies}

Overdrivelser? Typ "Det er veldig viktig for meg at du gjør dette fordi da blir
jeg glad"? Vise til litteratur som underbygger sånt.

\subsection{Temperature}
Hallucination.

\subsection{Pretraining?}

\subsection{Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)}
Context, affordances.

\subsection{More models}

More models more good?

\subsection{Tool calling}

Can give the LLM access to tools, e.g. methods for adding objects etc.

\section{GUI visualisations}

Maybe: Frontend client - web GUI - Ivar
If Loki does its job effectively, we can create a web based frontend for doing the process. It could do the same as Loki, but with greater ease of use.
Having a GUI allows for making neat visualisations.
Motivate why our enhanced test cases are better by showing it.

\section{Instant validation of test case syntax}
Compiler-stuff. Syntax. Parsing.

% Og: Verifisere at spawn locations ikke overlapper/kolliderer

\section{Other datasets}

We used dataset x for our experiments. Scenario datasets y and z can also be used
