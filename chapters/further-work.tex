Hallucination.

\section{GUI visualisations}

Maybe: Frontend client - web GUI - Ivar
If Loki does its job effectively, we can create a web based frontend for doing the process. It could do the same as Loki, but with greater ease of use.
Having a GUI allows for making neat visualisations.
Motivate why our enhanced test cases are better by showing it.

\section{Instant validation of test case syntax}
Compiler-stuff. Syntax. Parsing.

% Og: Verifisere at spawn locations ikke overlapper/kolliderer

\section{Other datasets}

We used dataset x for our experiments. Scenario datasets y and z can also be used
