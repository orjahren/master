\section{Motivation}

Conventional cars are ubiquitous in society. Whether for freight trafficking or for humans, cars
have great flexibility with their ability to go wherever without requiring tailored infrastructure
such as railway tracks. They do, however, have one major weak point --- the human driver. For this
reason, industry and academia have put forward efforts to enhancing cars with \acrfull{ads}
capabilities. By \emph{empowering humans} with autonomous vehicles, it is expected that traffic
efficiency will increase and road fatalities will fall.

Due to the critical safety situation of manoeuvring a car In a public setting where other external
actors are present, it is essential that \acrlongpl{ads} are thoroughly tested before they are
deployed so that they are confirmed to be sufficiently safe and capable of handling the situations
in which they may typically end up. But due to the complicated nature of the typical \acrshort{ads}
operating environment, coming up with exhaustive system test solutions is near impossible. For this
reason we want a way of testing the system that is capable of pushing the \acrlong{ads} to its
limits such that we can measure its performance and see if it is capable of handling complex
scenarios.

Having an existing repository of \acrlong{ads} test cases, such as DeepScenario we wish to improve
them. \acrfullpl{llm} have demonstrated great capabilities of context learning and emergent
abilities, which begs the question of their  applicability for \acrshort{ads} testing.  There are
various methods of testing  \acrlong{ads}. Can these existing test methods be improved by applying
\acrshort{llm} technology to them?

% Yet, testing is \textit{important} for \acrlong{ads}, and text case generation is costly. We
% therefore pose the question: Can \acrshort{llms} be applied for (1) lowering the cost of testing,
% and (2) increasing the thouroughness of \acrlong{ads} testing?

\section{Problem description}\label{sec:problemDescription}

%We identify \num{3} principal areas for how \acrshortpl{llm} can be employed to benefit

% TODO: Denne kan renames til noe a la "human factors"? \subsection{Cost and bias}

Traditional techniques for obtaining \acrshort{ads} scenarios rely on high skilled manual labour.
This incurs a significant cost, and is a major limitation in obtaining a large number of good
scenarios.

%\subsection{Impossible to test all scenarios}
Moreover, even if we were to imagine a world in which we had infinite \begin{inparaenum}
    \item time and
    \item money, \end{inparaenum} we would not be able to successfully account for every possible
scenario.
There will always be more, unforseen permutations of actors and actions. This is a reality
we need to deal with.
One possible measure of remedying with this, could be to \textit{decrease} the
driveability of our existing scenarios. Decreasing the driveability is not the same as suddenly
having access to the infinite set of possible scenarios, but it is reasonable to infer that being
able to \textit{test} the \acrshort{ads} (in a simulator) on these enhanced low-driveability
scenarios will leave it better fit for encountering other low-driveability scenarios in the wild
during operation. Having access to such a set of less driveable scenarios will allow \acrshort{ads}
operators to test their \acrshort{ads} that they assume to be working, and see if it still is able
to handle all these more challenging scenarios. If it is not, they will have gained a meaningful
insight into the workings of their \acrshort{ads} and can take action to remedy the fault before it
causes harm in the real world. And if the \acrshort{ads} \emph{does} work, they can be more
confident in their system.

%\subsection{Edge cases}

Finally, edge cases can be a major issue for \acrshort{ads} adaptation. The \textit{tail problem} as
it is known in the \acrshort{ml} field posits that \acrfull{ml} tasks are faced with a long tail of
unseen cases. We can map these unseen cases, to our unseen \acrshort{ads} scenarios. Because of
this, an \acrshort{ads} can be at risk of encountering an unseen edge case scenario during operation
-- something for which it might never have been tested.
% TODO: Burde referere ting om tail problem? 
Arguing that the \acrshort{ads} would probably crash simply due to it finding itself in an unseen
scenario is not logical. But it is important to keep in mind that the end we are pursing in the
broader adaption of \acrfullpl{ads}, is increased safety and efficiency on our roads. Not
sufficiently testing the \acrshort{ads} before deploying it would not serve our goal of increasing
road safety -- it would be a gamble with human lives. Not all edge cases are relevant for all
contexts and environments. As such, \acrshort{ads} system developers could employ \acrshortpl{llm}
to obtain more of a certain scneario that they wish to test, if they were to only be in posession of
a tangentially related form. Say for example that they wished to obtain a set of scenario in which
certain properties are met, or certain situations occur. Or if they wish to wash out the bias of the
human scenario authors.
