\section{Background}



\subsection{Large language models}
\subsubsection{Forklare LLMer}
\subsubsection{Prompt engineering}
\subsection{Autonomous driving system testing}
\subsubsection{Simulators}
\subsubsection{Carla}

The simulator CARLA\cite{Dosovitskiy17} will be used for running the test cases.\\
DeepScenario\cite{DeepScenario} is an existing dataset of test cases for the testing of autonomous driving systems.

\subsubsection{Test case generation}

There are existing frameworks for generating test cases, e.g. RTCM \cite{RTCM}. This project will apply large language models(LLMs) to test cases generated by these existing methods and review what improvements can be made. 
We will focus on test cases for autonomous vehicles.
By applying large LLMs to test cases for self driving cars such as \cite{DeepScenario, CriticalScenarios}, we can compare the outcome of the original test with its initial counterpart and review what effect the LLM modification has had. 

\subsubsection{Test case validation}
Hallucination
\subsubsection{Test case running}
More relevant for Carla section?
\subsubsection{Test case result extraction}
TODO: Find a way of extracting test results
