  abstract  = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

  abstract  = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

  abstract   = {This article surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub “prompt-based learning.” Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x′ that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x̂, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: It allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this article, we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.,&nbsp;the choice of pre-trained language models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts but also release other resources, e.g., a website  including constantly updated survey and paperlist.},

  abstract  = {Based on our experience of collaborating with industry, we observed that test case generation usually relies on test case specifications (TCSs), commonly written in natural language, specifying test cases of a System Under Test at a high level of abstraction. In practice, TCSs are commonly used by test engineers as reference documents to perform these activities: 1) Manually executing test cases in TCSs; 2) Manually coding test cases in a test scripting language for automated test case execution. In the latter case, the gap between TCSs and executable test cases has to be filled by test engineers, requiring a significant amount of coding effort and domain knowledge. Motivated by the above observations from the industry, we first propose, in this paper, a TCS language, named as Restricted Test Case Modeling (RTCM), which is based on natural language and composed of an easy-to-use template, a set of restriction rules and keywords. Second, we propose a test case generation tool (aToucan4Test), which takes TCSs in RTCM as input and generates either manual test cases or automatically executable test cases, based on various coverage criteria defined on RTCM. To assess the applicability of RTCM, we manually modeled two industrial case studies and examined 30 automatically generated TCSs. To evaluate aToucan4Test, we modeled three subsystems of a Video Conferencing System developed by Cisco Systems, Norway and automatically generated executable test cases. These test cases were successfully executed on two commercial software versions. In the paper, we also discuss our experience of applying RTCM and aToucan4Test in an industrial context and compare our approach with other model-based testing methodologies.},

  abstract       = {Vehicle to everything (V2X) is a new generation of information and communication technologies that connect vehicles to everything. It not only creates a more comfortable and safer transportation environment, but also has much significance for improving traffic efficiency, and reducing pollution and accident rates. At present, the technology is still in the exploratory stage, and the problems of traffic safety and information security brought about by V2X applications have not yet been fully evaluated. Prior to marketization, we must ensure the reliability and maturity of the technology, which must be rigorously tested and verified. Therefore, testing is an important part of V2X technology. This article focuses on the V2X application requirements and its challenges, the need of testing. Then we also investigate and summarize the testing methods for V2X in the communication process and describe them in detail from the architectural perspective. In addition, we have proposed an end-to-end testing system combining virtual and real environments which can undertake the test task of the full protocol stack.},
